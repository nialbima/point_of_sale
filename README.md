Name: EAT MORE PIZZA

Instructions:
* Click begin new order.
* Add your menu items by clicking on each of their names.

* If you need to adjust the tip, you can use the toggle.

To-do (in order of priority):
* more styling
* fix the order bug so it doesn't care about the wonky index position
* add the server toggle: built in, and you already wrote default vals
* add the comping functionality
* add vegetarian flag
* add a button for "PRINT BILL" that returns an alert on "BILL PAID" for "how'd they pay " (if cash) "how much" (calc. change  )


Design stuff:
* centering: center header
* make cleaner div for order #s
  * border
* assign some animations
* add some extra color
* use setTimeout to change .attrs on event fire
* add quant field to main div
* use "quant 0" to delete the order
