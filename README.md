This is a point of sale app!


To-do (in order of priority):
-good styling, it looks fine but not awesome right now.
-give the buttons background-img for the type of food(drinks are all beer)
-fix the order bug so it doesn't care about the wonky index position
-add the server toggle: built in, and you already wrote default vals
-add the comping functionality
-add vegetarian flag
-add a button for "PRINT BILL" that returns an alert on "BILL PAID" for "how'd they pay " (if cash) "how much" (calc. change  )
